Two visual mode keybindings:

* `<leader>m`: Evaluate selection with the Python 3 interpreter and echo
  the result (if any)
* `<leader>M`: Evaluate selection with the Python 3 interpreter and put
  the result (if any) on the next line in the buffer.

Multiline selections are supported.

State is preserved as in `:python3` commands.
